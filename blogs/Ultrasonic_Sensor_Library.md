# Ultrasonic Sensor Library
To use the ultrasonic sensor to read in distance data, we need to create a library so that we can call a function and get the current distance returned. 
The basic principle is to send a high pulse from the ultrasonic sensor's trigger gpio pin and read a high pulse on the echo pin
