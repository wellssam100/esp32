CMakeLists.txt defines how to build the project as a whole
Doesn't do anything specific, that is saved for the sub-Cmake files. It provides access to the libraries needed by child Cmake files.

ESP-IDF expects a directory named main. It is implicitly referenced through the esp-idf build system. 
main contains the application logic
main/main.c is the entry point
main/CMakeLists.txt is the file that specifies how to compile the source files

sdkconfig is the file generated by running idf.py menuconfig

components can hold reusable modules
